## Torii - Networking & Indexing

Torii is an automatic indexer for dojo worlds. Built in rust to be blazingly fast and exceptionally scalable. Torii provides a fully typed, dynamically generated GraphqQL interface and a high performance gRPC api for binding clients to the world state.

### Usage

Torii leverages world introspection to bootstrap directly from an onchain deployment. Simply run:

```sh
torii --world <World Address>
```

You'll have a GraphQL API running at `http://localhost:8080/graphql` and a gRPC api at `http://localhost:8080/grpc`

## Installation

The `torii` binary can be installed via [`dojoup`](../../getting-started/quick-start.md), our dedicated installation package manager.

### Installing from Source

If you prefer to install from the source code:

```sh
cargo install --path ./crates/torii --profile local --force
```

This will install Torii and the required dependencies on your local system.
